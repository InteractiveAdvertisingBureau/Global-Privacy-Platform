## Introduction
This is one of the IAB Tech Lab Global Privacy Platform Specifications. It defines the API for Consent Management Platforms (CMPs). The CMP API is the interface a CMP provides to callers (web and in-app) to access information regarding the privacy preferences disclosed and obtained from the end user by the CMP. Both required functionality that the CMP must provide and optional features are described.


### About the Global Privacy Platform
The Global Privacy Platform (GPP) enables advertisers, publishers and technology vendors in the digital advertising industry to adapt to regulatory demands across markets. It is a single protocol designed to streamline transmitting privacy, consent, and consumer choice signals from sites and apps to ad tech providers. IAB Tech Lab stewards the development of these technical specifications.

## CMP API

### What does the CMP API support?

Consent Management Platforms (CMPs) provide a user interface to establish transparency to users, and obtain consent or register objections from end users, and capture their preferences in signals. These signals are packaged in a standardized, easily communicated payload called a GPP String. The CMP API provides a standardized means for parties, such as the hosting publisher or an advertising vendor, to access these preferences managed by the CMP.

Using the API, scripts may obtain the GPP String payload and the information it contains, which is ready to use without having to understand how to “unpack” the payload format. This makes it easy to make immediate data processing decisions based on the returned information.

This API allows for accessing signals across legislations, regulations, and standards. It provides a common interface that can be used to access underlying APIs such as the [IAB TCF](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v2.md) and [USPrivacy](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/USPrivacy/blob/master/CCPA/USP%20API.md).

#### API Prefixes

In order to distinguish between the different underlying APIs, each API will be assigned a prefix. A complete list of available API prefixes can be found in the [Section information](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/Global-Privacy-Platform/blob/main/Sections/Section%20Information.md).


Example API prefixes: 


<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>API</strong></td>
	  <td><strong>Prefix</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	  <td>IAB TCF1 (EU)</td>    
<td><code>tcfeuv1 (no longer used)</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	  <td>IAB TCF v2 (EU)</td>    
<td><code>tcfeuv2</code></td>
     </tr>
  <tr>
	  <td>IAB TCF v1 (Canada)</td>    
<td><code>tcfcav1</code></td>
   </tr>
  <tr>
	  <td>IAB CCPA/USP v1</td>    
<td><code>uspv1</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>



### How does the CMP provide the API?


Every consent manager must provide the following API function: 

<code>__gpp(command, callback, parameter, [version])</code>


Requirements for the interface: 
- The <code>__gpp</code> function must always be a function and cannot be any other type, even if only temporarily on initialization – the API must be able to handle calls at all times.
- The command must always be a string.
- The callback must always be a function.
- Parameter can be of mixed type depending on used command
- The <code>__gpp</code> function does not have a return value
- If a CMP cannot immediately respond to a query, the CMP must queue all calls to the function and execute them later. The CMP must execute the commands in the same order in which the function was called.
- A CMP must support all generic commands. All generic commands must always be available when a <code>__gpp</code> function is present on the page. This means that “[stub code](#stubcode)” that supports all generic commands must be in place before/during CMP load.
	


### What required API commands must a CMP support? <a name="javascript"></a>


All CMPs must support all generic commands. Generic commands are commands that can be used independent of [section specifications](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/Global-Privacy-Platform/blob/main/Sections/SectionInformation.md). All generic commands must always be executed immediately without any asynchronous logic and call the supplied callback function immediately. The generic commands are: [‘ping’](#ping), [‘addEventListener’](#addeventlistener), [‘removeEventListener’](#removeeventlistener), [‘hasSection’](#hassection), [‘getSection’](#getsection), and [‘getField’](#getfield). 


### What is CMP ID?


Regional section policy writers may require CMPs to register to operate within the policies for that section. In these cases, CMP IDs must be used if the CMP has an ID. For CMPs that are not registered, a value of 1 must be used by string creators who do not have a CMP ID and are not using a commercially available CMP.

**Examples:**

Publisher A looking to create a GPP string that will contain the section for the US National approach must use 1 as value for CMP ID since the MSPA does not have CMP registration requirements.

Publisher B looking to create a GPP string that will contain sections for the US National approach or the TCF EU must register themselves or work with a registered CMP and use the assigned CMP ID in accordance with the TCF Policies.

________
#### `ping` <a name="ping"></a>

The `ping` command can be used to determine the state of the CMP. The callback shall be called with a <a href="https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/Global-Privacy-Platform/blob/main/Core/CMP%20API%20Specification.md#pingreturn-">PingReturn</a> object as the value of the `data` parameter. A value of `false` will be passed as the argument to the `success` parameter if the CMP fails to process this command.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>argument</strong></td>
    <td><strong>type</strong></td>
    <td><strong>value</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>command</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>"ping"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>callback</code></td>
    <td>function</td>
    <td>function (data: <a href="https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/Global-Privacy-Platform/blob/main/Core/CMP%20API%20Specification.md#pingreturn-">PingReturn</a>, success: boolean)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>parameter</code></td>
    <td>not used</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>     
</table>



*Example:*

``` javascript
__gpp('ping', myFunction);
```

#### `PingReturn` <a name="pingreturn"></a>

This object contains information about the loading status and configuration of the CMP.

```javascript
PingReturn = {

gppVersion : String, // must be “Version.Subversion”, current: “1.1”

cmpStatus : String, // possible values: stub, loading, loaded, error

cmpDisplayStatus: String, // possible values: hidden, visible, disabled

signalStatus : String, // possible values: not ready, ready

supportedAPIs : Array of string, // list of supported APIs (section ids and prefix strings), e.g. used while loading. Example: ["2:tcfeuv2","6:uspv1"] 

cmpId : Number, // IAB assigned CMP ID, may be 0 during stub/loading. Reference the above CMP ID section for additional information.

sectionList : Array of Number, // may be empty during loading of the CMP

applicableSections: Array of Number, // Section ID considered to be in force for this transaction. In most cases, this field should have a single section ID. In rare occasions where such a single section ID can not be determined, the field may contain up to 2 values. During the transition period which ends on September 30, 2023, the legacy USPrivacy section may be determined as applicable along with another US section. In this case, the field may contain up to 3 values where one of the values is 6, representing the legacy USPrivacy section. The value can be 0 or a Section ID specified by the Publisher / Advertiser, during stub / load. When no section is applicable, the value will be [-1].

gppString: String // the complete encoded GPP string, may be empty during CMP load

parsedSections: Object // The parsedSections property represents an object of all parsed sections of the gppString property that are supported by the API on this page (see supportedAPIs property). The object contains one property for each supported API with the name of the API as the property name and the value as a parsed representation of this section (similar to getSection command). If a section is supported but not represented in the gppString, it is omitted in the parsedSections object.

}

```


**Ping Status Codes**

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Status Code</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Applicable for</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'stub'</code></td>

    <td>CMP not yet loaded - stub still in place</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>'loaded'</code></td>
    <td>cmpStatus</td>
    <td>CMP is finished loading</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>  
    <td><code>'error'</code></td>
    <td>cmpStatus</td>
    <td>CMP is in an error state.  A CMP shall not repsond to any other API requests if this cmpStatus is present. A CMP may set this status if, for any reason, it is unable to perform the operation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>cmpDisplayStatus</td>
    <td>User interface is currently displayed</td>

     </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>Null / not set</code></td>
    <td>cmpDisplayStatus</td>
    <td>Is NULL when there is no display layer. Display layer refers to a modal that the user may interact with to express their choices. When no such modal is present, the value is NULL,  e.g. when there is only a Do Not Sell or Share Personal Data link on the page that when clicked does not launch a modal. In this example, vendors should rely solely on signalStatus and the cmpDisplayStatus will be NULL / not set.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>'not ready'</code></td>
    <td>signalStatus</td>
    <td>The CMP is not ready to respond to any calling scripts with the corresponding GPP string and applicable section ids.</td>
  </tr>	
  <tr>
    <td><code>'ready'</code></td>
    <td>signalStatus</td>
    <td>The CMP is ready to respond to any calling scripts with the corresponding GPP string and applicable section ids. The ‘ready’ status should only be sent when the GPP string contains the section that is currently applicable with the user’s current choices reflected.  E.g. the ‘ready’ status should be signaled when applicableSection == -1 or applicableSection != 1 and the GPP string contains the section corresponding to applicableSection reflecting the user’s current choices.</td>
    </tr>
</table>


___________
#### `addEventListener` <a name="addeventlistener"></a> 

The `addEventListener` command can be used to define a callback function that can be used to detect changes in the CMP. The callback shall be called with an `EventListener` object immediately. The GPP script will then call the callback function and return a new EventListener object every time the CMP detects a change (see events below).  A value of `false` will be passed as the argument to the `success` parameter if the CMP fails to process this command. 


<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>argument</strong></td>
    <td><strong>type</strong></td>
    <td><strong>value</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>command</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>"addEventListener"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>callback</code></td>
    <td>function</td>
    <td>function (data: <a href="https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/Global-Privacy-Platform/blob/main/Core/CMP%20API%20Specification.md#eventlistener-">EventListener</a>, success: boolean)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>parameter</code></td>
    <td>not used</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
 </table>
 


*Example:*

```javascript
__gpp('addEventListener', myFunction);
```
  

#### `EventListener` <a name="eventlistenerobject"></a>

The EventListener object is defined as: 

```javascript
EventListener = {
eventName : String, // for possible values see events below
listenerId : Number, // Registered ID of the listener
data: mixed, // data supplied by the underlying API. 
pingData : object // see PingReturn

}
```


A call to the `addEventListener` command must always trigger an immediate call to the callback function. When registering new event listeners, the CMP (and stub) must therefore generate new listenerIds for each call to this command.


<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Event Name</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Type of data property</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>listenerRegistered</code></td>
    <td>boolean</td>
    <td>Only used within the return object to addEventListener command. The data property signals whether the event listener was registered successfully. If data equals true, a listenerId must be sent, otherwise the listenerId must be 0 (zero).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>listenerRemoved</code></td>
    <td>boolean</td>
    <td>Only used within the return object to removeEventListener command. The data property signals whether the event listener was successfully removed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>cmpStatus</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Event is called whenever the status of the CMP changes (e.g. the CMP has finished loading). The data property will contain the new status (e.g. “loaded”)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>cmpDisplayStatus</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Event is called whenever the display status of the CMP changes (e.g. the CMP shows the consent layer). The data property will contain the new display status (e.g. “visible”). Note that this is only applicable when a consent layer is displayed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td><code>signalStatus</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Event is called whenever the signalStatus changes. The data property will contain the new signalStatus value.
   </td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>error</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Event can be called by the CMP in case of an error. The data property will contain a human readable error message.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>sectionChange</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Event is called whenever the status or content of a section changes (e.g. consent is obtained). The data property will indicate the name (API prefix) of the changed section.</td>
   </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>[API.prefix] or [API-prefix].[Eventname]</code></td>
    <td>mixed</td>
    <td>Event is called by the CMP depending on the specific API needs (e.g. IAB TCF EU may specify different events than IAB USP). If the API defines different event types, these can be used by combining API-prefix and eventname, If the API does not specify different event types (e.g. in IAB TCF v2.0), the API-prefix is used as name. The data property will contain mixed data depending on API.</td>
     </td>
     </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The “signalStatus” event shall always be the first (if applicable) and last in a chain of events being fired by the CMP. 

A CMP **must** send all relevant events and it **must** send them in a specific order so that listeners (e.g. vendors) can understand when a task is completed. Whenever the CMP starts to change or is about to change any of the existing sections or is processing user input for an existing GPP string, it **must always** first set "signalStatus" to "not ready" and fire the corresponding event. It can then perform the tasks (e.g. change the sections along with firing the section change events). Only when all tasks are completed, the CMP can set the "signalStatus" to "ready" and fire the corresponding event.

_Event Order Example 1:_ 

The following example illustrates the  events that are fired, and the other order in which they are fired, assuming support for IAB TCF Canada for a new user.

___________
#### `removeEventListener` <a name="removeeventlistener"></a>

The `removeEventListener` command can be used to remove an existing event listener. The callback shall be called with `false` as the argument for the `data` parameter if the listener could not be removed (e.g. the CMP cannot find a registered listener corresponding to `listenerId`). A value of `false` will be passed as the argument to the `success` parameter if the CMP fails to process this command.


<table> 
  <tr>
    <td><strong>argument</strong></td>
    <td><strong>type</strong></td>
    <td><strong>value</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>command</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>"removeEventListener"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>callback</code></td>
    <td>function</td>
    <td>function (data: boolean, success: boolean)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>parameter</code></td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>ID of the listenerId property that was returned from addEventListener command</td>
  </tr>
 </table>
 
 


*Example:*

```javascript
__gpp('removeEventListener', myFunction, listenerId);
``` 

__________
#### `hasSection` <a name="hassection"></a>

The `hasSection` command can be used to detect if the CMP has generated a section of a certain specification. The callback shall be called with `true` as the argument for the `data` parameter if the CMP has generated a section for the requested API prefix string. The `data` parameter may be `null` when the CMP is not yet loaded. A value of `false` will be passed as the argument to the `success` parameter if the CMP fails to process this command.



<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>argument</strong></td>
    <td><strong>type</strong></td>
    <td><strong>value</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>command</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>"hasSection"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>callback</code></td>
    <td>function</td>
    <td>function (data: boolean, success: boolean)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>parameter</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>API Prefix string</td>
  </tr>
 </table> 
 
Example:

A client wants to ask the CMP if there is data for IAB TCF CA v1.0:

```javascript
__gpp('hasSection', myFunction, "tcfcav1");
```

______
#### `getSection` <a name="getsection"></a>

The `getSection` command can be used to receive the (parsed) representation of a section of a certain specification. The callback shall be called with the (parsed) representation as the argument for the data parameter. The parsed representation of a section is an array of objects, where each object represents one sub-section of this section in the order that is given by the section specification. For example, the data parameter for the TCF Canada will be an array with one or two objects (Core sub-section plus optional publisher purposes sub-section). Each object is composed of the fields defined by the section specification.

The data parameter may be `null` for sections that don't allow accessing the section data object outside an event handler. It may also be `null` when the CMP is not yet loaded.



<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>argument</strong></td>
    <td><strong>type</strong></td>
    <td><strong>value</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>command</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>"getSection"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>callback</code></td>
    <td>function</td>
    <td>function (data: array of objects or null, success: boolean)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>parameter</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>API Prefix string</td>
  </tr>
 </table>



For example, client can ask the CMP to get the IAB TCF CA v1.0 TCData: 


```javascript
__gpp('getSection', myFunction, "tcfcav1"); 
```

Example value of data passed to the callback: 
```javascript
[
 /* Core Sub-section */
 {
  Version:1, 
  Created: Date (Thu Apr 13 2023 18:07:12 GMT+0200),
  LastUpdated: Date (Thu Apr 13 2023 18:07:12 GMT+0200),
  CmpId: 31, 
  CmpVersion: 123,
  ConsentScreen: 5,
  ...
  }, 
  /* Publisher Purposes Sub-section (optional) */
 {
  subsectionType:3, 
  PubPurposesExpressConsent : [1,2,3,4,5],
  PubPurposesImpliedConsent  : [6,7,8,9],
  ...
  } 
 ]
```

______
#### `getField` <a name="getfield"></a>

The `getField` command can be used to receive a specific field out of a certain section. The callback shall be called with the value of the requested field as the argument for the `data` parameter. The `data` parameter may be `null` for fields in sections that don't allow accessing the section data object outside an event handler.  It may also be `null` when the CMP is not yet loaded.


<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>argument</strong></td>
    <td><strong>type</strong></td>
    <td><strong>value</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>command</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>"getField"</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>callback</code></td>
    <td>function</td>
    <td>function (data: mixed or null, success)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>parameter</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>API Prefix string + "." (dot) + fieldname</td>
  </tr>
 </table>



For example, a client can ask the CMP to get the last updated field from the IAB TCF CA v1.0 TCData. 

```javascript
__gpp('getField', myFunction, "tcfcav1.LastUpdated");
```

### What are non-generic commands?

In addition to the generic commands, a CMP can support other commands that are defined by any GPP section. See the non-generic commands by reviewing a specific sections’ specifications. Any GPP section that wants to make use of the GPP API spec should define a set of commands as follows: 

```
Example command xyz

Command:     prefix.command

Callback:    function (…)    or   “not used”

Parameter:   data type       or   “not used”

A description of the command, what it does, what it’s meant for, when to use it and how.
```

Using the IAB TCF CA v1.0 as an example, the `getVendorList`command would be defined as: 

```
getVendorList

Command:     iabtcfcav1.getVendorList

Callback:    function (gvl: GlobalVendorList, success: boolean)

Parameter:   (optional) int or string

Calling with this command and a valid vendorListVersion parameter shall return a GlobalVendorList object to the callback function….
```

In the example above, a call to` __gpp (‘iabtcfcav1.getVendorList’,myfunction)` will be treated in the same way as a call to `__tcfapi(‘getVendorList’,2,myfunction)` by the CMP.

## In-App Details

How is a CMP used in-app? <a name="gppinapp"></a>

The GPP standardizes storage locations and naming for the content of the GPP data and GPP string so that ad tags embedded in mobile apps can find the GPP data and string in a consistent way. 


The pre-parsed GPP data as well as the GPP string shall be stored under [NSUserDefaults](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuserdefaults#1664798?language=objc)(iOS) or [SharedPreferences](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences) (Android). This will allow:

- Vendors to easily access GPP data
- GPP data to persist across app sessions
- GPP data to be portable between CMPs to provide flexibility for a publisher to exchange one CMP SDK for another
- Vendors within an app to avoid code duplication by not being required to include a GPP string decoder while still enabling all typical use cases

> **Note:** If a Publisher chooses to remove a CMP SDK from their app they are responsible for clearing all IABGPP_* vestigial values for users so that vendors do not continue to use the GPP data therein. 

### In-App Key Names

The key names are a combination of the “IABGPP_” prefix followed by the section prefix followed by an underline and then followed by the name of the value (field name from the corresponding specification) it represents. The relevant sections documented in this spec are HDR (header), TCFEU2 (tcfv2), TCFCA1 (Canadian TCF), USP1 (U.S. Privacy).

 [NSUserDefaults](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuserdefaults#1664798?language=objc) (iOS) or [SharedPreferences](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences) (Android) values

The data stored in the in-app storage is not encoded or compressed because the storage is private to the application. However, the resulting string will follow the encoding rules as listed in this spec.


Valid data types are Integer and String. All other data types such as Boolean, Date and Array (Range, Bitfield, Fibonacci-Range, …) should be converted into an Integer or String representation as follows:

How do third-party SDKs (vendors) access the consent information in-app?

On both Android OS and iOS, the vendor can be notified when the values of the shared keys changes.  See [NSUserDefaultsDidChangeNotification](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuserdefaultsdidchangenotification?language=objc) and [SharedPreferences.OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener.](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences.OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener.html) 


On Android OS, the GPP data and GPP string shall be stored in the default Shared Preferences for the application context. This can be accessed using the `getDefaultSharedPreferences` method from the *android.preference.PreferenceManager* class using the application context. The GPP data values can be retrieved from the application Shared Preferences by key name using the get methods on the *android.content.SharedPreferences* class.


## Connected TV (CTV) Details

How is a CMP used in the CTV context?

The context of the CTV application will determine the storage locations and naming of the GPP data.


### Web Runtime

Applications running in a web runtime environment that supports, at minimum, the Web Storage (Second Edition) specification shall follow all storage and naming conventions detailed in the [Javascript](#javascript) section of this spec. Data is to be retrieved using the Generic and Non-generic API commands, offering a consistent interface for Vendors to access GPP information.

Should data not persist in Web Storage beyond the lifecycle of the application (application close, standby, or device shutdown), all data storage and naming conventions are to follow the specifications outlined in the [CTV Native Private Storage](#native) section of this spec.


### Native <a name="native"></a>

Native CTV applications are to follow the naming conventions of the GPP data and GPP String outlined in the [How is GPP used in-app](#gppinapp) section of this spec. Data is to be limited to the context of the Application and inaccessible to external applications.
 
 
 
*Application Preferences (Registry)*

 
Application Preferences, also referred to as a Registry in certain CTV environments, shall be used in a Native CTV Application environment under the condition that the GPP data and GPP String fit within the device constraints. Private Storage is to be used if the GPP data and GPP String do not fit within the device constraints.
 
 
*Private Storage*
 
Private Storage shall be used under the condition that the CTV environment does not offer a Web Runtime that supports the Web Storage (Second Edition) specification, data does not persist beyond the lifecycle of the Application, or offer an Application Preferences (Registry) interface. The GPP data and GPP String are to be saved in a standardized and private storage space. Files are to follow the same naming convention as the key names detailed in the [How is GPP used in-app](#gppinapp) section of this spec with the contents being the value of the corresponding key.
 
> **Note:** CTV Applications require proper permission scopes to be configured to read and write to the virtual Application file system.

Example of determining vendor consent under TCF Canada
The following example demonstrates how a vendor can listen to changes for IAB TCF Canada and find out if consent is given for a specific vendor or purpose.

```javascript
if(__gpp)
{
 __gpp('addEventListener', function (evt, success)
 {
  //callback will receive all events, we only want to react on signalStatus ready events
  if(evt.eventName !== 'signalStatus' || evt.data !== 'ready')
  {return ;}

  //if only the GPP String is needed, it can be taken directly from pingData.gppString
  var gppString = evt.pingData.gppString;
	 
  //get the data from the TCF Canada section
  //Note: You might also want to check if TCF Canada is in the pingData.applicableSections
  if ('tcfcav1' in evt.pingData.parsedSections) 
  { 
   var data = evt.pingData.parsedSections.tcfcav1;
   var vendorConsent = data[0].VendorExpressConsent; 
   var vendorImpConsent = data[0].VendorImpliedConsent;
   var purposeConsent = data[0].PurposesExpressConsent; 
   // ... do something Canadian !
  }
 });
}
```

## How can vendors that use iframes call the CMP API from an iframe?

### Using postmessage

The `window.postMessage()` method may be used from a child iframe to make requests from a parent or any ancestor frame's CMP API. To locate an ancestor frame capable of responding to postMessage() CMP API calls, search for an ancestor frame that has a child frame named `'__gppLocator'`.

CMPs shall create an event listener to handle postMessage requests via the CMP “stub” API script so that postMessage events can be queued and processed by the full-implementation of the CMP API as soon as it is initialized.

### Sent Message

The sent message shall follow the form outlined below. The command, parameter and version object properties correspond to their namesake parameters defined as method argument parameters for `__gpp()` method. The “sent message” also requires a unique `callId` property to help match the request with a response. The callId property shall be either a string or a number, but the calling script shall not use the two types interchangeably.

```javascript
{
  __gppCall: {
    command: 'command',
    parameter: 'parameter,
    version: '1.1',
    callId: 'randomID'
  }
}
```

The `event.data` object payload shall follow the form outlined below. The `returnValue` object property shall be the corresponding TC data object for the command used upon sending the “sent message”. The success object property shall reflect the `__gpp()` success callback argument and the callId will correspond to the “sent message” unique id passed in the callId property.

```javascript
{
  __gppReturn: {
   returnValue: returnValue,
   success: boolean,
   callId: uniqueId
  }
}
```
